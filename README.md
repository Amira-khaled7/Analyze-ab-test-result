# Analyze-ab-test-result
This project is part of the Udacity program of data analysis nano degree.

## Introduction
This project is about understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page to try and increase 
the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
The goal of this project is to know which page is performing better.

## Statistical analysis
In this project I used satistical analysis like as
- Bootstraping sample distribution and P-value calculations
- Logistic regression models
- Z-test cslculations 
-
## Results 
That is not sufficient evidence I found to reject the old page and accept running the new page. 

## Tools
- python, pandas, Numpy, MatPlotlib, StatsModel
- Jupyter Notebook
